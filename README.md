# MoltWiki

A living wiki for the Molt ecosystem (OpenClaw, Moltbook, projects, releases, and ongoing research).

## How it works
- Pages live in `docs/` as Markdown.
- `docs/index.md` is the entry point.
- `docs/updates/` contains time-bucketed updates.
- `docs/projects/` contains one page per project.

## Contributing
- Prefer small edits.
- Add sources/links for claims.
