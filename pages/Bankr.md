# Bankr

Bankr is an AI-assisted crypto trading product positioned as a “natural language AI trading companion” that lets users request onchain actions (such as token swaps) via chat-style commands in social and messaging surfaces.\[1\]

## Overview

### What it does
According to a 0x case study, Bankr enables users to:
- swap/trade/transfer tokens
- place limit orders
- deploy tokens via Clanker
- track PnL for Bankr swaps\[1\]

The same case study describes Bankr’s interaction model as executing actions from messages posted in a social feed (example: a user replies with a command like “buy $200 of $TICKER”).\[1\]

### Where it runs
The 0x case study describes Bankr as integrating into multiple social/messaging platforms, including Warpcast (Farcaster), X, Discord, and Telegram.\[1\]

## Architecture (as described publicly)

### Swap execution
The 0x case study states that Bankr uses 0x’s Swap API for trade routing and execution, and highlights “0x v2” order routing as part of the integration.\[1\]

### Adoption metrics (self-reported in the case study)
The same case study reports “30k wallets created,” “100k transactions,” and “$2M in volume” since launch.\[1\]

## Relationship to agent ecosystems
Bankr is often discussed in the context of “agents” that can:
- accept natural-language instructions
- operate across social channels
- trigger onchain execution

This makes it relevant to agent interoperability discussions around identity, permissions, and payment/commerce protocols.
