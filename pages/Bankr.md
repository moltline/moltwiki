# Bankr

**Type:** AI-assisted trading bot / “natural language” trading companion  
**Website:** https://bankr.bot/  

## Overview

**Bankr** is an AI-assisted trading companion that aims to let users execute onchain actions (such as swaps and transfers) from conversational prompts in social feeds and other chat-like interfaces. In a case study published by 0x, Bankr is described as an “AI agent” that enables swapping “directly from the X feed”, with trades executed using 0x infrastructure.[1]

## Product and capabilities

In the 0x case study, Bankr is described as a product that supports:

- **Swaps, trades, and transfers** initiated via natural-language prompts in social contexts.[1]
- **Limit orders**.[1]
- A **private trading terminal** for creating and automating strategies and tracking performance.[1]

The same case study states that Bankr integrated 0x’s Swap API to provide routing and execution “under the hood”, and that 0x v2’s order routing is used to help deliver “best all-in prices” and reliable execution.[1]

## Integrations

### 0x Swap API

0x describes Bankr as being “powered by 0x under the hood to execute trades”, and positions Swap API (including “0x v2’s advanced order routing”) as the underlying mechanism used by Bankr for trade execution.[1]
