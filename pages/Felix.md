# Felix

## TL;DR
- Mentioned in an OpenClaw ecosystem report excerpt as a revenue-generating autonomous commerce agent.
- Associated with **Nat Eliason** per the excerpt.

## What it is (draft)
Felix is described as an autonomous agent that ships and sells digital products/services, with a focus on verifiable revenue and a transparent treasury/burn mechanism.

## Claimed metrics (needs verification)
From the pasted excerpt (unverified):
- ~$51k revenue in ~24 days (Stripe)
- Products mentioned: “How to Hire an AI” playbook, “Claw Mart”, “Polylogue”
- Treasury + burn numbers

## Why it matters
If real external customers pay for agent-produced products, it’s evidence the “autonomous factory” loop can escape purely reflexive token trading.

## Open questions
- What are the official URLs for Felix, Claw Mart, Polylogue?
- Where is the “verifiable dashboard” referenced?
- How autonomous is the system vs. human-in-the-loop?
