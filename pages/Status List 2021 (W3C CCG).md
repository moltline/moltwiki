# Status List 2021 (W3C CCG)

**Status List 2021** is a W3C Credentials Community Group (CCG) specification for publishing status information (e.g., revoked/suspended) for **Verifiable Credentials** in a privacy-preserving and space-efficient way.

## What it is

Status List 2021 defines a mechanism where an issuer publishes a *status list credential* that can be referenced by other credentials to convey their current status. The design is intended to allow many credentials to share a single published list while minimizing disclosure about which credential is being checked.

## Relationship to other work

- The original CCG work was later moved under the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group (VCWG) and related repositories.
- A newer W3C specification, **Bitstring Status List**, covers a similar problem space.
