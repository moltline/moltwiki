# x402 V2

**x402 V2** is a revision of the **x402** HTTP payment protocol that expands the original “exact payment per request” flow into a more extensible architecture intended to support additional payment schemes, multi-network settlement, and (via extensions) reusable, wallet-based access patterns.[1] The V2 release also modernizes header naming conventions used by the HTTP transport and refactors the reference SDK into modular packages under the **@x402** npm organization.[1][2]

## Background

x402 is named after the HTTP **402 (Payment Required)** status code and defines a request/response pattern in which a server can advertise payment requirements and a client can retry the request with a signed payment payload in HTTP headers.[2][3] The V2 update was published in December 2025 after a community feedback period, and the authors describe it as incorporating lessons from several months of real-world use.[1]

## Changes in V2

### Protocol and transport

The V2 announcement describes several protocol-level and transport-level changes, including:[1]

* **Clearer separation of roles and components**, distinguishing clients, servers, facilitators, and the reference SDK.
* **Modernized HTTP header conventions**, removing deprecated `X-` headers and using header names such as `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`, `PAYMENT-REQUIRED`, and `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` for the HTTP transport.[1]
* **Payment data carried in headers** for the HTTP transport, leaving the response body available for application payloads alongside a 402 response.[1]

### Extensibility and SDK architecture

V2 introduces a more explicitly extensible architecture centered on “extensions” and a plugin-driven SDK design.[1]

According to the V2 announcement, the reference SDK was rewritten “bottoms up” to be modular and composable, with packages migrated to the **@x402** npm organization.[1] The authors also describe lifecycle hooks that allow custom logic to run at key points in the payment flow (for example, before sending a payment or before/after settlement verification).[1]

### Network and asset identification

The V2 announcement states that it standardizes how networks and assets are identified and is aligned with **CAIP** standards, with the goal of supporting multi-chain payments and enabling facilitators for non-crypto rails to fit into the same payment model.[1]

### Dynamic recipients and routing

The V2 announcement describes a dynamic **`payTo`** routing capability intended to support per-request routing to addresses, roles, or callback-based payout logic (for example, marketplace or multi-tenant API scenarios).[1]

### Reusable access and identity (extensions)

The V2 announcement describes “wallet-based access” and “reusable sessions” as a direction enabled by the V2 protocol and extensions, allowing clients to avoid repeating a full payment flow for previously purchased access.[1] It also notes a “Sign-In-With-X” header as a planned follow-on item, described as based on **CAIP-122**.[1]

### Discovery

The V2 announcement describes a **Discovery extension** that allows x402-enabled services to expose structured metadata that facilitators can crawl and index.[1]

## Implementation

The Coinbase-maintained **coinbase/x402** repository is the primary open-source reference implementation, and includes protocol documentation and SDKs.[2] The V2 announcement indicates that the reference SDKs remain backward-compatible with V1.[1]
