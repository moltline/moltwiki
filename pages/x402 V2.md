# x402 V2

**x402 V2** is a revised version of the **x402** HTTP-native payments protocol that extends the original design beyond single-request, fixed-amount payments and refactors the standard for greater modularity and interoperability.[1] The V2 effort describes changes to roles, data types, and extensibility so that implementers can add new payment networks and schemes without modifying the core specification.[1]

## Background

x402 is named after the HTTP **402 (Payment Required)** status code and uses a standard HTTP request/response pattern in which a server can return a 402 response advertising payment requirements, and a client can retry the request with a signed payment payload in headers.[2][3] HTTP semantics reserve 402 for future use, which x402 repurposes as a machine-readable signal for payment negotiation.[4]

## Motivation

The V2 announcement frames the update as a response to early production usage and a desire to make the protocol easier to implement across additional chains and payment rails.[1] Changes highlighted include clearer separations between protocol, SDK, and facilitator implementations; reduced redundancy in type definitions; and a formal mechanism for extensions so that experimental functionality can be added without forking the core protocol.[1]

## Design and features

### Modular and extensible architecture

x402 V2 introduces an explicit concept of **extensions** and describes a plug-in oriented architecture in which chains, assets, and payment schemes are registered rather than hard-coded into a single SDK implementation.[1] The V2 announcement also describes lifecycle hooks intended to let implementers inject custom logic at different stages of the payment flow (for example, before sending a payment or after settlement verification).[1]

### Modernized header usage

The V2 announcement describes modernizing the HTTP transport by removing deprecated `X-` prefixed headers and using `PAYMENT-REQUIRED`, `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`, and `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` as the primary header names for the payment handshake.[1]

### Multi-network and multi-asset identification

V2 is described as standardizing how networks and assets are identified and aligning with **CAIP** conventions so that the same payment format can be used across multiple chains and, via facilitators, potentially across legacy rails.[1][5]

### Dynamic routing and pricing

The V2 announcement describes a dynamic `payTo` routing concept intended to support per-request payment recipients (for example, multi-tenant APIs or marketplaces) and enable dynamic pricing based on request inputs.[1]

### Sessions and wallet-based access

V2 describes a foundation for **reusable access** in which clients can avoid repeating the full payment flow for subsequent calls if the resource has been purchased previously, enabling session-like and subscription-like patterns.[1] The announcement also notes planned work on a sign-in header based on **CAIP-122** for proving wallet control as part of such identity and session mechanisms.[1][6]

## Relationship to other agent payment work

The **A2A x402 Payments Extension** adapts x402-style payment negotiation to the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol by defining data structures and task-state transitions for requiring and submitting a payment payload as part of agent task execution.[7]
