# Web Payments Working Group

The **Web Payments Working Group (WPWG)** is a [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/) working group whose mission is to make payments easier and more secure on the Web. The group has produced and maintained standards in the W3C Web Payments ecosystem, including APIs that support web-based checkout and payment apps.

## Overview

W3C’s Web Payments work aims to reduce fragmentation in web payments by standardizing:

- APIs that allow a merchant website to request payment and receive a response.
- Mechanisms for web-based payment apps ("payment handlers") to integrate with browsers.
- Supporting specifications for identifying payment methods and describing payment method capabilities.

## Scope and deliverables

The group’s charter describes the WPWG’s goals, scope, and deliverables, including standardizing an API to allow web applications to participate in payment flows and related message formats and interactions.
