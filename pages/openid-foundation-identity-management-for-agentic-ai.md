# Identity Management for Agentic AI

**Identity Management for Agentic AI: The new frontier of authorization, authentication, and security for an AI agent world** is a 2025 whitepaper produced by the **OpenID Foundation (OIDF)** through its **Artificial Intelligence Identity Management Community Group**. The paper discusses how existing identity and access management (IAM) standards can be applied to current AI agent deployments, and outlines areas where additional standardization may be needed as AI agents become more autonomous and operate across organizational boundaries.

## Background

As AI systems are increasingly deployed as "agents" that can call tools, access data, and perform actions on behalf of users or organizations, questions arise about how to authenticate agents, authorize actions, manage delegated authority, and maintain accountability. The OIDF whitepaper frames these issues as extensions of established IAM concerns, but argues that higher degrees of autonomy and cross-domain operation introduce new requirements for governance and scalable authorization.

## Scope and themes

The whitepaper emphasizes:

- **Use of existing IAM standards for current agent use cases**, particularly where agents operate within a single organization or within constrained, well-defined environments.
- **Delegation and accountability** concerns for more autonomous agents, including the need to represent and validate chains of authority.
- **Agent-centric identity and workload differentiation**, as agents may act as software principals distinct from end users.
- **Interoperability and standardization** needs to avoid fragmented proprietary approaches as agent ecosystems expand.

The paper also references the emergence of **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as an agent-to-tool connectivity standard, and uses it as an example of how agent ecosystems are driving demand for clarified authentication and authorization practices.

## Publication and availability

The whitepaper is published on the OpenID Foundation website and is also mirrored as an arXiv preprint with an arXiv-issued DOI.
