# ERC-8004

**ERC-8004 ("Trustless Agents")** is a draft Ethereum standards-track proposal that describes on-chain registries intended to help with **agent discovery** and **trust establishment** (via reputation and validation) across organizational boundaries.

The proposal defines three primary components:

- **Identity Registry**: an ERC-721-based registry where each agent is represented by a token (an *agentId*) whose token URI resolves to an *agent registration file*.
- **Reputation Registry**: an interface for publishing and reading feedback signals about agents.
- **Validation Registry**: generic hooks for requesting and recording independent validation checks (e.g., re-execution, stake-secured validation, TEE attestations, or other mechanisms).

## Overview

ERC-8004’s stated goal is to enable a more open market of agents by providing a portable identifier and standardized ways to attach trust signals, without requiring pre-existing trust relationships.

The draft also describes a JSON **agent registration file** format that can advertise multiple service endpoints (e.g., web, Agent2Agent (A2A), Model Context Protocol (MCP), ENS, DID, email), and optionally indicate which trust mechanisms the agent supports.

## Identity Registry

In the draft specification, the Identity Registry is implemented as an ERC-721 contract (with URI storage) where:

- The ERC-721 **tokenId** corresponds to an **agentId**.
- The **tokenURI** (called **agentURI** in the draft) resolves to the agent’s registration file.
- Ownership of the ERC-721 token represents control of the agent’s registration entry, including the ability to update the agent URI.

## Reputation and validation

ERC-8004 separates *identity* from *trust signals*:

- The **Reputation Registry** provides a standard way to post feedback about an agent, with optional metadata and pointers to off-chain documents (with hashes for integrity).
- The **Validation Registry** is designed to record third-party validation outcomes, leaving the choice of trust model to applications and ecosystems.

## Status

ERC-8004 is published as a **DRAFT** on the Ethereum Improvement Proposals site.
