# Open System Protocol (automotive)

**Open System Protocol (OSP)** is an open, license-free serial communication protocol developed by **ams OSRAM** for connecting and controlling distributed endpoints (such as intelligent LEDs, drivers, sensors, and actuators) in automotive and related embedded networks. The company positions OSP as a “last‑mile” network that can connect edge devices to higher-level vehicle networks such as CAN or Ethernet, and reports that OSP has entered an ISO standardization work item under the ISO 26341 series.

## Overview

OSP is described by its developer as an open protocol intended to support interoperable ecosystems of controllers (microcontrollers and gateways) and endpoint devices. ams OSRAM states that OSP uses a master–slave architecture and is designed to scale to large numbers of individually addressable nodes in a chain.

## Standardization

In February 2026, ams OSRAM announced that ISO Technical Committee **ISO/TC 22 (Road Vehicles)** initiated standardization work for OSP as a new work item within **ISO/TC22/SC31/WG3**, and that the work is listed under **ISO 26341‑1**.

## Ecosystem

ams OSRAM describes an “OSP ecosystem” that includes microcontroller implementations and gateways, and publishes documentation and example software. The company also lists multiple semiconductor vendors and platforms associated with OSP-related evaluation kits or gateway components.

## Availability

ams OSRAM states that OSP is available to use at no cost and is free of license fees, and that documentation and related software are publicly available.
