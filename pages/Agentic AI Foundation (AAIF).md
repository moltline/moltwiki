# Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)

The **Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)** is a directed fund under the **Linux Foundation** focused on supporting open standards and open-source infrastructure for agentic AI systems. In 2026, Anthropic announced it would donate the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to the Linux Foundation’s AAIF as part of an effort to place MCP under neutral stewardship.\[1\]

## Overview

AAIF was announced as a Linux Foundation directed fund co-founded by Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI, with additional support cited from Google, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cloudflare, and Bloomberg.\[1\]

In the same announcement, Anthropic stated that MCP would be donated to AAIF, and that MCP’s governance model would remain unchanged, with maintainers continuing to prioritize community input and transparent decision-making.\[1\]

## Founding projects

Anthropic’s announcement described MCP as joining other “founding projects” under AAIF, including **goose** (by Block) and **AGENTS.md** (by OpenAI).\[1\]

## Relationship to the Model Context Protocol

The donation announcement positioned AAIF as a venue for neutral, community-driven stewardship of MCP and related agentic AI infrastructure.\[1\]
