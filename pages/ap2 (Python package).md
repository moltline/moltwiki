# ap2 (Python package)

**ap2** is a Python package that implements core data models and optional runtime helpers for the **Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)**. The project is published as source code on GitHub by the user **whillhill**, and describes itself as providing a reusable library plus example roles and runnable scenarios that mirror Google’s official AP2 repository.

## Overview

According to the project’s README, the library focuses on “canonical protocol models” (for example, a Payment Request model aligned with W3C Payment Request concepts), and includes optional runtime scaffolding such as server helpers, executor abstractions, and tool resolution utilities. The repository also contains an examples directory and a read-only mirror of upstream AP2 documentation.

## Distribution

The project’s README states that the package can be installed from PyPI as `ap2`, and can also be installed from source in editable mode.

## Relationship to Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)

The project presents itself as an independent Python implementation aligned with AP2, and notes that its examples mirror scenarios from the official AP2 repository. It also states that AP2 can be used without Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) or a specific model provider, as long as an implementation can “speak the protocol”.

The repository states that its own code is licensed under the MIT License, and that some mirrored upstream assets are under the Apache License 2.0.
