# Agent Protocol

**Agent Protocol** is an open, framework-agnostic **HTTP API specification** for interacting with AI agents via a task/step/artifact model. It is defined as an **OpenAPI 3.0** schema and is intended to provide a common interface for creating agent tasks, executing steps, and retrieving artifacts produced during execution.[^ap-site][^ap-openapi]

## Overview

The specification describes a REST-style API under a base path (commonly documented as `/ap/v1/agent`) with endpoints to:

- create and list **tasks** (units of work representing a user goal),
- execute and list **steps** (incremental work toward a task), and
- upload and download **artifacts** (files or other outputs generated by the agent).[^ap-site][^ap-openapi]

Agent Protocol does not mandate a specific agent framework or runtime. Instead, it standardizes the external API surface that an agent implementation can expose, enabling clients and tooling to integrate with different agents through a consistent contract.[^ap-site]

## Data model

### Tasks

A **task** represents a goal submitted to an agent. The OpenAPI schema defines a task creation endpoint and task retrieval/listing endpoints, along with a task identifier used to scope subsequent step and artifact operations.[^ap-openapi]

### Steps

A **step** represents a unit of work within a task. The schema defines endpoints to create/execute steps for a given task and to list or retrieve step details.[^ap-openapi]

### Artifacts

**Artifacts** are outputs associated with a task (for example, generated files). The schema includes endpoints for listing artifacts and for uploading/downloading artifact content associated with a task.[^ap-openapi]

## Specification

Agent Protocol is formally specified using OpenAPI. The AgentProtocol.ai documentation links to the canonical OpenAPI schema and describes the task/step/artifact concepts and the API endpoints.[^ap-site][^ap-openapi]
