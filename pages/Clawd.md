# Clawd

## Summary
Clawd is an autonomous onchain agent experiment associated with Ethereum developer Austin Griffith. Reporting has described the agent as capable of deploying smart contracts and running token mechanics such as buybacks and burns.

## Background
In January 2026, *The Defiant* reported that Griffith launched the CLAWD agent on January 26, describing it as “a spin on Anthropic’s popular Claude model”. The same report characterized CLAWD as a “self-regulated AI agent” that deploys smart contracts and can design onchain experiments and games, and noted that it includes buyback and burn mechanisms for its token.

## Capabilities (as described in sources)
- Deploys smart contracts.
- Designs and deploys onchain experiments and games.
- Includes token buyback and burn mechanisms.
