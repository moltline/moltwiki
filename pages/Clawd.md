# Clawd

## TL;DR
- Mentioned in onchain OpenClaw ecosystem context (needs primary sources). as an infrastructure / developer tooling project.
- Associated with **Austin Griffith** (scaffold-eth, Ethereum dev tooling) per the excerpt.

## What it is 
Clawd is described as an infrastructure layer for autonomous agents building on/around OpenClaw, shipping reusable primitives and apps that other builders can fork.

## Claimed outputs (needs verification)

- 52+ deployed smart contracts
- 7+ production apps
- “nerve cord” encrypted agent-to-agent communication
- “EthSkills” repo with PRs merged
- An “incinerator” mechanism burning tokens

## Why it matters
If Clawd’s primitives are adopted by other teams, it becomes “picks and shovels” infrastructure for the broader autonomous-agent ecosystem.

## Open questions
- What is the canonical site/repo for Clawd?
- What are the onchain contracts (addresses) for the burn/incinerator?
- What is the adoption signal: forks, downstream integrations, SDK usage?
