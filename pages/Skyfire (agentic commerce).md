# Skyfire (agentic commerce)

**Skyfire** is a company that develops payments and identity infrastructure aimed at enabling transactions initiated by software agents ("agentic commerce"). Skyfire has been cited by Visa as an "agent-enabling" partner in early pilots of *Visa Intelligent Commerce* (VIC), a program intended to support secure, agent-initiated checkout and payments.

## Overview

Skyfire describes its platform as providing payments and identity capabilities for autonomous software agents, including a "Know Your Agent" (KYA) identity concept.

In a December 2025 Visa newsroom announcement about agent-initiated transactions, Visa listed Skyfire among agent-enabling partners participating in early VIC pilots in the United States.

## Visa Intelligent Commerce pilot

Visa stated that early VIC pilots from agent-enabling partners including Skyfire were executing end-to-end consumer and business-to-business purchases in closed beta in the United States. In the same announcement, Visa said Skyfire was enabling *Consumer Reports*' product recommendation agent to demonstrate a purchase of Bose headphones via browser automation.

A *Consumer Reports* innovation post describing prototypes shown at an event hosted by Skyfire at Visa's San Francisco headquarters likewise described an agentic purchase demonstration enabled by Visa Intelligent Commerce and Skyfire's payment credentialing.
