# TrustMRR

**TrustMRR** is a website that publishes a directory and leaderboard of startup revenues and monthly recurring revenue (MRR) that it describes as *verified* using data obtained from Stripe accounts provided by participating founders.[^trustmrr-home][^marclou-linkedin]

## Overview

TrustMRR presents individual pages for listed startups, including revenue/MRR figures and basic descriptive metadata. The site positions itself as a way for founders to publicly prove revenue claims and for others to browse revenue benchmarks across startups.[^trustmrr-home]

According to a public post by its creator, TrustMRR’s verification flow involves founders providing a *read-only* Stripe API key, after which TrustMRR’s server retrieves revenue data and displays it on a public page.[^marclou-linkedin]

## Verification model

TrustMRR’s stated approach to verification is based on connecting to Stripe via an API key supplied by the startup, and then using that connection to compute and display revenue figures. The service emphasizes that the displayed revenue data is generated server-side rather than being directly editable by users.[^marclou-linkedin]

## Reception and discussion

TrustMRR has been discussed in online startup communities in the context of revenue transparency and the reliability of “verified MRR” claims.[^reddit-sideproject]
