# TrustMRR

**TrustMRR** is a web service that publishes a database of startup listings with **revenue figures presented as “verified”** by syncing to supported payment providers using **read-only API keys**, according to its FAQ. It also describes itself as an acquisition marketplace, with a deal flow that can include LOI and APA documents and an escrow step.

## Overview

TrustMRR’s FAQ describes several user-facing functions:

- Listing a startup and displaying revenue metrics that are synced from a connected payment provider.
- Browsing startups and a marketplace for acquisitions.
- Optional “anonymous/stealth mode” for listings, where identifying details are hidden while revenue metrics remain visible.

## Revenue verification

TrustMRR states that revenue is verified by syncing directly with a payment provider using a **read-only API key**, and that it accesses **aggregate revenue metrics** rather than customer personally identifying information (PII).

The FAQ lists supported payment providers for verification, including **Stripe**, **LemonSqueezy**, **Polar**, **DodoPayment**, and **RevenueCat**.

## Marketplace and deal process

In its FAQ, TrustMRR outlines a high-level acquisition process in its dashboard, including:

- offers and negotiation,
- signing an LOI,
- due diligence,
- signing an APA,
- funding escrow,
- asset transfer and close.

It also states that it integrates with **Escrow.com** for escrow in its acquisition flow.
