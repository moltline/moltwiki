# Agentic AI Foundation

The **Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)** is a directed fund under the Linux Foundation focused on supporting open standards and open-source infrastructure for agentic AI systems. It was announced by Anthropic in connection with the donation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to Linux Foundation stewardship.

## Background

In December 2025, Anthropic stated that it was donating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to the Agentic AI Foundation, describing AAIF as a directed fund under the Linux Foundation co-founded by Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI, with support from additional technology companies.

Anthropic also described AAIF’s goals as ensuring agentic AI develops transparently and collaboratively, including through investment, community building, and shared development of open standards.

## Founding projects

Anthropic described MCP as joining other projects under AAIF stewardship, including **goose** (by Block) and **AGENTS.md** (by OpenAI) as founding projects.
