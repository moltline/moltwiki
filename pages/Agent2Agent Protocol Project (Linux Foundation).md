# Agent2Agent Protocol Project (Linux Foundation)

The **Agent2Agent Protocol Project** (often shortened to **A2A Project**) is a Linux Foundation–hosted open source project centered on the **Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol**, an open protocol for secure agent-to-agent communication and interoperability between AI agents across vendors, frameworks, and platforms. The project was announced by the Linux Foundation in June 2025, with the protocol originally created and launched by Google earlier in 2025.

## Overview

The A2A protocol is intended to help organizations run **multi-agent systems** where independently built agents can:

- **Discover** other agents and their capabilities
- **Exchange information securely**
- **Coordinate work** on tasks that may be short-lived or long-running

Google has described A2A as complementary to Anthropic’s **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, positioning MCP as a way to provide tools and context to agents, while A2A provides a standard way for agents to communicate and collaborate with each other.

## History

- **April 2025:** Google announced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol as an open protocol for agent interoperability.
- **June 2025:** The Linux Foundation announced the launch of the Agent2Agent (A2A) project as a vendor-neutral home for the protocol and its ongoing development.

## Governance and positioning

According to the Linux Foundation, the project is intended to provide **neutral governance** and to support collaboration across a broad ecosystem. The Linux Foundation announcement describes the A2A protocol as designed for enterprise environments and emphasizes interoperability across platforms, vendors, and frameworks.
