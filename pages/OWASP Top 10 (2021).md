# OWASP Top 10 (2021)

The **OWASP Top 10 (2021)** is a list of the ten most critical security risks to web applications, published by the [Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/). The document is intended as a security awareness resource for developers, security professionals, and organizations building or operating web applications.

OWASP describes the Top 10 as a *standard awareness document* representing a broad consensus on key web application security risks, and positions it as a common starting point for improving secure coding and application security programs.[^owasp-project]
