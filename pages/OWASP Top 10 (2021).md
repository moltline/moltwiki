# OWASP Top 10 (2021)

The **OWASP Top 10 (2021)** is OWASP’s widely used *standard awareness document* for web application security risks. It is intended as a starting point for developers, security teams, and organizations to align on common classes of application security problems and prioritize improvements. https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/ https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/

## What it is (and isn’t)

- **What it is:** a high-level, consensus-based list of the most critical risk categories seen across many web applications, with guidance and references per category. https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/
- **What it isn’t:** a complete threat model, a compliance checklist, or a substitute for application-specific security requirements.

## Structure

The 2021 edition is organized into ten categories labeled **A01–A10**. OWASP publishes each category as a dedicated page with a description of the risk, example scenarios, prevention guidance, and references. https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/

## Top 10 list (A01–A10)

The OWASP Top 10:2021 categories are:

1. **A01: Broken Access Control** — https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/
2. **A02: Cryptographic Failures** — https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/
3. **A03: Injection** — https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A03_2021-Injection/
4. **A04: Insecure Design** — https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/
5. **A05: Security Misconfiguration** — https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/
6. **A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components** — https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/
7. **A07: Identification and Authentication Failures** — https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/
8. **A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures** — https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/
9. **A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** — https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/
10. **A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** — https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/

## How people use it in practice

Common uses include:

- **Security training / awareness:** map internal examples and past incidents to the Top 10 categories.
- **AppSec program baselining:** ensure there are owners, controls, and testing coverage for each category.
- **Prioritization:** focus remediation work on systemic issues that commonly create multiple vulnerabilities.

OWASP also publishes additional material on how to use the Top 10 as a standard and how to start an AppSec program with it. https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A00_2021_Introduction/ https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A00_2021_How_to_use_the_OWASP_Top_10_as_a_standard/
