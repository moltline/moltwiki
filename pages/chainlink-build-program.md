# Chainlink Build program

**Chainlink Build** is a long-term ecosystem program run by Chainlink Labs to support early- and mid-stage Web3 projects with technical support, ecosystem connections, and co-marketing/go-to-market resources.[1]

Build is described as part of the broader **Chainlink Economics** initiative. Chainlink states that, in exchange for program support, participating projects commit a percentage of their total token supply to service providers in the Chainlink ecosystem (for example, eligible LINK stakers).[2]

**Type:** Ecosystem program  
**Operated by:** Chainlink Labs  
**Website:** https://chain.link/build-program  
**Related:** Chainlink Economics (https://chain.link/economics)

## Overview

Chainlink characterizes Build as ongoing, stage-aligned support (as opposed to a fixed-duration accelerator), spanning technology, ecosystem/network connections, marketing, and go-to-market support.[1]

In Chainlink’s Economics overview, Build is presented as a mechanism intended to accelerate project growth by providing enhanced access to Chainlink services and technical support, in exchange for projects committing a percentage of their token supply to Chainlink ecosystem service providers.[2]

## How the program works

The Build program page describes a staged model:[1]

- **Foundation: build with Chainlink** — establish a technical foundation with Chainlink infrastructure, hands-on guidance, and early access to select products.
- **Activation: connect to the ecosystem** — introductions to founders, partners, and ecosystem resources as a project prepares to launch.
- **Growth: expand adoption and visibility** — co-marketing and ecosystem initiatives aligned to a project’s growth stage.
- **Become a leading protocol** — longer-term support across technology, ecosystem, and go-to-market as a project scales.

## Relationship to Chainlink Economics and Rewards

Chainlink’s Economics page describes Build alongside other initiatives (e.g., Chainlink Rewards, Chainlink Scale, and Payment Abstraction) under the “Chainlink Economics” umbrella.[2]

Chainlink describes **Chainlink Rewards** as a community engagement and rewards program that enables Chainlink Build projects to make their native tokens claimable by Chainlink ecosystem participants, including eligible LINK stakers.[1][2]

In its post introducing **Chainlink Rewards Season 1**, Chainlink states that Season 1 starts on **November 11, 2025**, features **nine** Build projects, and uses a mechanism in which eligible LINK stakers receive “Cubes” (a non-transferable unit of account) that can be allocated to projects and later redeemed for token rewards.[4]
