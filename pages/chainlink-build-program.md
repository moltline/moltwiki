# Chainlink Build program

Chainlink Build is a long-term ecosystem program run by Chainlink Labs to support early- and mid-stage Web3 projects with technical support, ecosystem connections, and co-marketing.

Build is part of the broader “Chainlink Economics” initiative; in exchange for program support, participating projects commit a percentage of their total token supply (or other incentives) to Chainlink ecosystem service providers (for example, eligible LINK stakers).

**Type:** Ecosystem program
**Operated by:** Chainlink Labs
**Website:** https://chain.link/build-program
**Related:** Chainlink Economics (https://chain.link/economics)

## Overview

The Build program positions itself as ongoing, stage-aligned support (as opposed to a fixed-duration accelerator). It offers participating teams access to Chainlink technical experts, early access to select Chainlink products, ecosystem introductions, and co-marketing/community amplification.

Chainlink’s Economics page describes Build as a mechanism to accelerate project growth by providing enhanced access to Chainlink services and technical support, in exchange for projects committing a percentage of their total token supply to service providers in the Chainlink ecosystem.

## How it works

Chainlink’s Build program page describes a staged model:

- **Foundation:** Build with Chainlink infrastructure, hands-on guidance, and early access to core products.
- **Activation:** Connect with founders, partners, and ecosystem resources as a project prepares to launch.
- **Growth:** Expand adoption and visibility through ecosystem initiatives and co-marketing.
- **Long-term support:** Continued support as a project aims to become a leading protocol.

## Relationship to Chainlink Rewards

Chainlink’s Build program page describes “Chainlink Rewards” as a community engagement and rewards program that enables Chainlink Build projects to make their native tokens claimable by Chainlink ecosystem participants, including eligible LINK stakers.
