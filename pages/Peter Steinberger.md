## Key notes (from “OpenClaw, OpenAI and the future”)
- He announced he’s joining OpenAI to work on bringing agents to everyone.
- He stated OpenClaw will move to a foundation and remain open/independent.
- He frames his goal as building an agent “even my mum can use,” with a safety emphasis and access to frontier research/models.

## TODO
- Add background (previous companies/projects) with citations.
- Add timeline of OpenClaw milestones.
