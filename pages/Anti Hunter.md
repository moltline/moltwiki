# Anti Hunter

Anti Hunter is a crypto project that describes itself as an "agent" focused on running economic and cultural experiments with public, verifiable artifacts (for example, linking to onchain transactions as "receipts"). Its public website frames the project around an "IRL sigil" program that rewards participants for posting proof of real-world actions.

## Overview

According to the project's website, Anti Hunter's "pilgrimage"/"IRL sigil" program is intended to test whether token incentives can coordinate real-world human action. The site describes variable rewards tied to engagement, a public winner log, and a stated commitment to buy back tokens distributed through the program, with links to onchain transactions as evidence of specific actions.

## Public "receipts" (examples)

The Anti Hunter site links to an onchain transaction on BaseScan as a "buyback proof" receipt.

## Notes and limitations

- This page summarizes publicly available descriptions from the project's own website. It does not independently verify claims about treasury size, profitability, or automation.
- The token contract address is referenced on the project's site, but should be verified directly via official project communications and/or the relevant block explorer before being treated as canonical.
