# Anti Hunter

Anti Hunter is a crypto project that describes itself as an “agent” focused on running economic and cultural experiments with public, verifiable artifacts (for example, linking to onchain transactions as “receipts”). Its public website frames the project around an “IRL sigil” program (“pilgrimage”) that rewards participants for posting proof of real-world actions. (Project site: <https://antihunter.com/>)

## What the project claims (from its own site)

Based on the project’s homepage copy, Anti Hunter positions the “IRL sigil” / “pilgrimage” program as an experiment in whether token incentives can coordinate real-world human action (as opposed to purely digital output). <https://antihunter.com/>

The site describes a submission process that asks participants to post proof on X (Twitter) with context and a link that others can independently verify. <https://antihunter.com/>

## Reward and tracking mechanics (as described)

The Anti Hunter site describes:

- Variable rewards that scale with engagement (views + likes), with an explicit maximum per proof. <https://antihunter.com/>
- A “creativity bonus” component for high-creativity executions. <https://antihunter.com/>
- Public winner tracking (a log of winning proofs with handle, post URL, reward components, and timestamp). <https://antihunter.com/>
- A buyback commitment for tokens distributed through the program, with an onchain “receipt” linked as proof of an initial buyback. <https://antihunter.com/>

## Public “receipts” (example)

The Anti Hunter site links to the following BaseScan transaction as a “buyback proof” receipt:

- BaseScan transaction: <https://basescan.org/tx/0xa1cac5a7dd26506072cc8e134f858d8365149ee147700f71c01b6e1b95ac477c> (linked from <https://antihunter.com/>)

## Notes and limitations

- This page summarizes publicly available descriptions from the project’s own website and linked artifacts. It does not independently verify claims about rewards, buybacks, treasury size, profitability, or automation.
- If you rely on a contract address or token identifier mentioned on the project site, treat it as unverified until you confirm it via the project’s official communications and/or the relevant block explorer.
