# Anti Hunter

## TL;DR
- Mentioned in onchain OpenClaw ecosystem context (needs primary sources). as an autonomous treasury manager / onchain venture desk.

## What it is 
Anti Hunter is described as an agent system that manages an onchain treasury with published receipts, and ships tooling for venture-style operations (CRM extraction, LP updates, founder triage).

## Claimed metrics (needs verification)

- ~$200k treasury
- realized PnL
- buyback/burn mechanics (noted as discretionary)

## Key risk (per excerpt)
- If value capture is discretionary, tokenholders depend on operator behavior.
- Market may price “brand exposure” that the onchain treasury does not actually hold.

## Open questions
- Canonical links, contract addresses, and the receipts dashboard?
- What is automated vs. manual?
