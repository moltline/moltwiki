# Synthetic ecology

**Synthetic ecology** is a research area concerned with the **design, construction, and study of engineered ecological communities**, especially **microbial consortia**, in order to understand ecological principles and to build communities that perform useful functions.[^zomorrodi2016] The field is closely related to synthetic biology and microbial ecology, but emphasizes **community-level design** (e.g., division of labor, cross-feeding, competition, stability) rather than engineering a single organism in isolation.[^zomorrodi2016]

## Overview

Natural microbial communities are central to biogeochemical cycling, health, and many biotechnological processes. Synthetic ecology applies a “bottom-up” approach: researchers assemble simplified communities from selected organisms (sometimes genetically modified) and then observe or model how interactions among members shape community dynamics and emergent properties.[^zomorrodi2016]

Engineered communities are studied both as **model systems** for testing ecological theory and as potential platforms for applications such as bioproduction, bioremediation, and environmental management.[^zomorrodi2016]

## Approaches

Synthetic ecology efforts commonly use one or more of the following strategies:[^zomorrodi2016]

- **Co-culturing wild-type species** under controlled conditions to reproduce or simplify interactions found in nature.
- **Engineering interdependence** (e.g., obligate cross-feeding) by genetic modifications that create metabolic dependencies between community members.
- **Circuit-mediated interactions**, such as quorum-sensing systems that implement predator–prey dynamics or controlled antagonism.
- **Environmental design**, where the growth medium or resource constraints are tuned to induce specific interaction networks.

## Community interactions and emergent properties

A central premise of synthetic ecology is that **interactions among species** can yield community-level behaviors not predictable from monocultures.[^zomorrodi2016] Interactions may be beneficial (e.g., metabolic exchange and syntrophy), negative (e.g., resource competition, inhibition), or parasitic (e.g., host–phage dynamics). These interaction types can influence:

- **Coexistence and biodiversity** within the community
- **Stability and resilience** to perturbations
- **Functional output**, such as production of a metabolite or degradation of a compound

## Modeling and design

Because even small communities can show complex dynamics, synthetic ecology frequently uses **mathematical and computational models** to interpret experiments and guide design. Reviews of the field emphasize approaches ranging from phenomenological interaction models to mechanistic methods (including metabolic network modeling) for predicting community behavior and for designing consortia with desired properties.[^zomorrodi2016]
