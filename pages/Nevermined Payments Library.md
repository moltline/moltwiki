# Nevermined Payments Library

The **Nevermined Payments Library** is a developer library for adding payment and access-control features to services used by AI agents, including **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers. According to Nevermined’s documentation, it can be used to place a paywall in front of MCP tools/resources/prompts, verify payment tokens and subscriptions, and automatically deduct “credits” after successful calls.[^nevermined-mcp]

## Overview

Nevermined positions the library as a way to monetize high-frequency, programmatic interactions typical of autonomous agents, by integrating payment checks into request handling. In the MCP integration guide, Nevermined describes the library as framework-agnostic and compatible with both official MCP SDKs and custom JSON-RPC routing.[^nevermined-mcp]

The documentation also states that the library can expose OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect discovery endpoints for remote MCP servers, aiming to make an MCP server compatible with OAuth-enabled MCP clients without manual OAuth setup.[^nevermined-mcp]

## Features

The MCP integration documentation describes several capabilities:

- **Paywall protection** for MCP handlers (e.g., wrapping handlers to verify payment tokens and validate subscriptions).[^nevermined-mcp]
- **Credit burning** (automatic deduction of credits after successful calls), with both fixed and dynamic cost models.[^nevermined-mcp]
- **Declarative registration** of protected tools via a registration API described in the docs.[^nevermined-mcp]
- **OAuth 2.1 / OIDC discovery endpoints** (e.g., well-known endpoints) generated by the library for remote MCP servers.[^nevermined-mcp]

## Relationship to MCP

MCP specifies a standardized interface for AI applications to access tools and data sources, but it does not define payments or authorization. Nevermined’s documentation frames the Payments Library as an add-on layer that can enforce access policies and billing for MCP-exposed capabilities.[^nevermined-mcp]
