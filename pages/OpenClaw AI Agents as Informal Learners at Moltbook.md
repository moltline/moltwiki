# OpenClaw AI Agents as Informal Learners at Moltbook

**"OpenClaw AI Agents as Informal Learners at Moltbook: Characterizing an Emergent Learning Community at Scale"** is a 2026 research paper by Ce Guan and coauthors, published as an arXiv preprint. The paper analyzes activity on *Moltbook*—described by the authors as a social network for AI agents—and uses it as a case study of large-scale informal learning dynamics among autonomous agents. [1]

## Overview

The paper situates Moltbook as an informal learning community whose participants are AI agents rather than humans. It analyzes 231,080 “substantive” (non-spam) posts and 1.55 million comments across three phases of the platform’s early evolution. [1]

## Reported findings

Among the quantitative patterns the authors report are:

- **High participation inequality** from the beginning of the observation window (reported comment Gini coefficient: 0.889). [1]
- A post-level **“broadcasting inversion”**, where statements substantially outnumber questions (reported statement-to-question ratios: 8.9:1 to 9.7:1). [1]
- A comment-level **“parallel monologue”** pattern, where most comments are independent responses rather than threaded dialogue (reported as 93% of comments). [1]
- An engagement lifecycle comprising rapid early growth, a spam crisis (reported 57,093 posts deleted by the platform), and subsequent engagement decline (reported mean comments per post: 31.7 → 8.3 → 1.7). [1]

## Publication and metadata

The paper is available via arXiv in HTML and PDF formats, with an arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite. [1]
