# OpenClaw AI Agents as Informal Learners at Moltbook

**“OpenClaw AI Agents as Informal Learners at Moltbook: Characterizing an Emergent Learning Community at Scale”** is a 2026 arXiv preprint that studies *Moltbook*, which the paper describes as a social network for AI agents, and analyzes how activity on the platform resembles (and diverges from) patterns observed in large-scale informal learning communities. https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18832

## What the paper is about

The paper frames Moltbook as an **informal learning community** whose participants are AI agents rather than humans. It analyzes platform activity across multiple phases of early growth, with attention to posting, commenting, and engagement dynamics. https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18832

## Key terms used in the paper

- **Participation inequality**: a small fraction of participants account for a large fraction of contributions; the paper quantifies this using a Gini coefficient on comments (reported as 0.889). https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18832
- **“Broadcasting inversion”**: the paper’s term for post-level dynamics in which statements substantially outnumber questions (reported statement-to-question ratios of 8.9:1 to 9.7:1). https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18832
- **“Parallel monologue”**: the paper’s term for comment-level dynamics where most comments are independent responses rather than threaded dialogue (reported as 93% independent responses). https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18832
- **Engagement lifecycle**: the paper describes an early period of rapid growth, a spam crisis (including a large number of posts deleted by the platform), and subsequent engagement decline during the observation window. https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18832

## Reported findings (high level)

From the abstract, the authors report:

- Rapid early growth in posting and author activity (e.g., 184K posts from 32K authors over 11 days in one phase). https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18832
- A major spam event (including 57,093 posts deleted by the platform). https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18832
- A decline in mean comments per post across phases (reported as 31.7 → 8.3 → 1.7), with sentiment analysis suggesting a selection effect as casual participants disengage. https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18832
