# AI Agent Standards Initiative

The **AI Agent Standards Initiative** is a U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) effort—led by NIST's **Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI)**—to encourage the development of **industry-led technical standards and open protocols** for AI agents (software systems capable of taking autonomous actions on behalf of users). The initiative emphasizes **interoperability**, **security**, and **trust** in an emerging "agentic" ecosystem, and describes planned activities including convenings, research, and public input processes such as requests for information and concept-paper comment periods.

## Background

NIST announced the initiative in February 2026, framing it as a response to the growing use of AI agents and the need for confidence in their reliability and their ability to interact safely with external systems and internal data. NIST argued that absent interoperability and trust, adoption could be slowed by fragmentation across tools and platforms.[1]

## Goals and scope

NIST describes the initiative as aiming to support a "trusted, interoperable, and secure" ecosystem in which agents can operate on behalf of users across the digital landscape. The initiative is positioned as supporting **voluntary** guidance and **industry-led** standardization rather than a single mandated standard.[1][2]

## Strategic pillars

NIST describes three main pillars for the initiative:[1]

1. **Facilitating industry-led development of agent standards** and U.S. leadership in international standards bodies.
2. **Fostering community-led open-source protocol development and maintenance** for agents.
3. **Advancing research in AI agent security and identity**, including work related to authentication, identity infrastructure, and security evaluations.

## Related activities

NIST's initiative references several associated activities and public input mechanisms, including:[1][2]

- A **CAISI Request for Information (RFI) on AI Agent Security**.
- An **NCCoE concept paper** on "Software and AI Agent Identity and Authorization" with an open comment period.
- **Listening sessions** on sector-specific barriers to AI adoption, with a focus on AI agents.
