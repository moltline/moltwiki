# EIP-7702 (Set Code for EOAs)

EIP-7702 is an Ethereum **Standards Track (Core)** proposal that introduces a new transaction type allowing an **Externally Owned Account (EOA)** to set code on itself in a controlled way. The set code is a **delegation indicator** (`0xef0100 || address`) that causes EVM execution to **load code from another address** while executing in the context of the EOA.

The proposal’s motivation is to make common smart-wallet UX improvements available to EOAs (e.g., batching, sponsorship, and constrained permissions) without requiring every user to migrate to a contract wallet first.

## What changes

- Adds a new EIP-2718 typed transaction (`SET_CODE_TX_TYPE = 0x04`) called a **set code transaction**.
- The transaction carries an `authorization_list` of signed tuples that authorize one or more EOAs to set delegation code.
- For each valid authorization tuple, the client writes the delegation indicator into the authorizing account’s code (or clears code when delegating to the zero address).

## Delegation indicator semantics

When an account’s code is a delegation indicator (`0xef0100 || address`):

- Code-executing operations (e.g., `CALL`, `DELEGATECALL`, etc.) must resolve and execute the code located at the pointed-to `address`, **in the context of the delegating account** (“authority”).
- The EIP specifies how code-reading opcodes behave in this delegated setting (notably, `CODESIZE`/`CODECOPY` differ from `EXTCODESIZE`/`EXTCODECOPY` on the delegating address).
- Clients must not follow delegation chains indefinitely; if a delegation points to another delegation, clients retrieve only the first code and stop.

## Why it matters (ecosystem impact)

EIP-7702 is part of the broader **account abstraction** roadmap. It is designed to help EOAs gain smart-wallet-like capabilities (batching, gas sponsorship, and privilege de-escalation) with less friction, potentially accelerating adoption of account abstraction patterns across applications.

ERC-4337 explicitly references support for **EIP-7702 authorizations** in its spec, highlighting interoperability between the “alt mempool” account abstraction approach and protocol-level EOA delegation.

## Security considerations (high level)

EIP-7702 introduces new security and UX failure modes that implementers need to handle carefully, including:

- Safe design of delegate contracts (the delegated code becomes security-critical).
- Front-running or race conditions around initialization flows.
- Storage management and assumptions when code executes “as” an EOA.
- Relayer / sponsorship models and their trust assumptions.

(See the EIP’s Security Considerations section for detailed discussion.)
