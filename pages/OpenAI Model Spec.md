# OpenAI Model Spec

The **OpenAI Model Spec** is a public document describing OpenAI’s intended behavioral guidelines for the models that power OpenAI products (including API models and ChatGPT). It lays out goals and trade-offs for model behavior, defines an instruction **chain of command** (e.g., root/system/developer/user), and provides detailed behavioral principles intended to guide how models respond across contexts.

The Model Spec is presented as a living document that OpenAI expects to update over time, and is published to increase transparency and invite public discussion. The site hosts dated versions (e.g., a published version dated **December 18, 2025**).

## What it covers (high level)

Public materials describe the Model Spec as including:

- An overview of OpenAI’s goals for model behavior (usefulness, safety, and alignment with user/developer needs).
- A governance framework for prioritizing instructions via a defined chain of command.
- Principles and rules intended to minimize harm and reduce execution errors.
- References to related policy documents (e.g., usage policies) and safety approaches.
