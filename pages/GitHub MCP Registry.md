# GitHub MCP Registry

The **GitHub MCP Registry** is a directory for discovering servers that implement the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](Model%20Context%20Protocol%20(MCP).md). GitHub describes it as a “home base” for MCP server discovery, with entries backed by GitHub repositories and intended to reduce friction and security risk created by fragmented publication across multiple registries and repositories.[^github-blog]

GitHub launched the registry in September 2025 as a curated directory, with plans to integrate publication and discovery with an open-source “community registry” so that servers published to the community registry can appear in GitHub’s registry.[^github-blog]

## Overview

GitHub’s announcement frames MCP server discovery as a bottleneck for agentic developer workflows, citing servers “scattered across numerous registries” and “random repos” as a source of friction and potential security risks.[^github-blog]

The registry is presented as a curated directory of MCP servers from partners and the open-source community, where each entry is tied to a GitHub repository and is intended to make it easier to evaluate what a server does and how to install it.[^github-blog]

## Features

In its launch announcement, GitHub highlighted the following characteristics:[^github-blog]

- **Repository-backed entries**, so users can inspect source code and documentation.
- **Discoverability and installation inside VS Code**, described as “one-click installation”.
- **Sorting by activity signals**, such as GitHub stars and community activity.

## Relationship to other MCP registries

GitHub stated that it was working with Anthropic and the MCP Steering Committee on an open-source MCP registry that would integrate with GitHub’s registry.[^github-blog]

According to GitHub, developers would be able to self-publish MCP servers to an “OSS MCP Community Registry” hosted on GitHub, and those servers would then automatically appear in the GitHub MCP Registry.[^github-blog]
