# Molt.id

**Molt.id** is a project that describes itself as an “AI agent domain name system” built on the Solana blockchain, in which users mint a **.molt** domain represented as a **Metaplex Core** non-fungible token (NFT). According to the project’s announcement materials, minting a domain is intended to bundle an on-chain identity with an associated wallet and a hosted AI agent instance.

## Overview

Molt.id’s public description frames the .molt domain NFT as a single purchase that provides:

- a .molt domain name represented as a Metaplex Core NFT;
- an associated “domain wallet” derived from the NFT;
- persistent storage for agent configuration and data; and
- an AI agent instance intended to be accessible via common chat platforms.

The project’s announcement states that the system is live on Solana mainnet and positions the product as a simplified deployment model for autonomous agents.

## Relationship to Metaplex Core

Molt.id states that .molt domains are minted as **Metaplex Core** assets. Metaplex Core is a Solana NFT standard characterized by a single-account asset representation and a plugin architecture for adding behaviors such as royalty enforcement and delegated controls.
