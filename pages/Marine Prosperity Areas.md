# Marine Prosperity Areas

**Marine Prosperity Areas** (MPpAs) are a proposed framework for **marine area-based conservation and ecosystem restoration** that explicitly aims to align **ecological recovery** with **human well-being**. The concept was introduced in a 2024 peer-reviewed article in *Frontiers in Marine Science* and is presented as a complement to established tools such as **marine protected areas (MPAs)** and other **area-based conservation (ABC)** measures, emphasizing that social and economic outcomes often operate on different timelines than ecological recovery.

## Overview

Marine Prosperity Areas are described as an area-based conservation approach that prioritizes **human prosperity** during periods of ecological recovery, rather than relying on ecosystem recovery alone to generate near-term social and economic benefits. In the originating proposal, MPpAs are positioned as a response to persistent challenges in marine protection, including:

- the long time horizons often required for full ecosystem recovery;
- opportunity costs borne by communities affected by restrictions on extractive activities;
- equity concerns in conservation planning and benefit distribution.

The MPpA framing highlights co-management and community participation, and proposes combining protection and restoration actions with targeted investments and interventions intended to improve livelihoods and access to social goods while ecological outcomes accrue over longer periods.

## Relationship to other area-based conservation tools

The MPpA proposal is framed within the broader set of **area-based conservation** measures used in marine policy and management, including:

- **Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)**, including fully protected and partially protected areas;
- **Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs)** (as used within the Convention on Biological Diversity context);
- locally governed or community-managed marine and coastal areas.

In this view, MPpAs extend the scope of area-based protections by treating human prosperity outcomes as a primary design objective alongside ecological objectives.

## Proposed implementation framework

The originating article outlines an implementation sequence described as three phases ("pillars"):

1. **Community engagement and co-design**: stakeholder engagement to define prosperity goals and co-design strategies.
2. **Capacity building, governance, and infrastructure**: developing governance structures, conflict-resolution mechanisms, and enforcement capacity.
3. **Monitoring, enforcement, and co-management**: ongoing monitoring and adaptive management, with shared governance and enforcement.

The proposal also emphasizes the use of community-based interventions and investments (for example, supporting diversified livelihoods or local enterprises) as a means to bridge the time gap between near-term social needs and longer-term ecological recovery.

## Reception and discussion

As of its introduction, Marine Prosperity Areas have been discussed in science communication outlets as a holistic approach intended to help reconcile ecological restoration goals with socio-economic realities, particularly in contexts where communities experience immediate costs from area closures.
