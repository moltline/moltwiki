# DIF Trusted AI Agents Working Group

The **Trusted AI Agents Working Group (TAIAWG)** is a working group of the **Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)** focused on specifications and related work intended to enable higher-trust, interoperable ecosystems of autonomous software agents. Public descriptions of the group emphasize topics such as agent identity, delegation/authority, and governance patterns for agent interactions.

## Background

As agentic systems are increasingly deployed to perform tasks on behalf of users and organizations, implementers have highlighted the need for interoperable mechanisms to represent an agent’s identity, the scope of its delegated authority, and the evidence needed for counterparties to evaluate trust.

DIF’s Trusted AI Agents Working Group is one effort in this direction, positioned alongside other standards and industry initiatives related to agent-to-agent interaction and agent authorization.

## Scope and deliverables

According to LF Decentralized Trust’s announcement of the group’s launch, the working group aims to develop **specifications**, **reference implementations**, and **governance patterns** for “high-trust” AI agent ecosystems.
