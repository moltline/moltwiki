# in-toto

**in-toto** is an open framework for securing the integrity of software supply chains. It provides a way for software producers to describe the steps (and authorized actors) involved in building and releasing an artifact, and for software consumers to verify that the expected steps were performed in the expected order.

Key concepts include:

- **Layout**: a cryptographically signed policy document (by the supply-chain owner) that defines the expected steps, who is authorized to perform them, and rules over artifacts.
- **Link metadata**: signed metadata produced as steps execute, which a verifier checks against the layout.
- **Inspections**: additional checks run during verification.

## Overview

Software supply chains commonly involve multiple steps such as building, testing, packaging, and distribution. in-toto is designed to make these steps *transparent* to a verifier by recording metadata about what was done, by whom, and in what order, so that a consumer can evaluate whether the resulting artifact was produced as intended.

The project publishes a technical specification describing the model and verification approach, and separately develops an "attestation framework" intended to express supply chain claims (with planned incorporation into future versions of the in-toto specification).

## How verification works (high level)

At a high level, in-toto verification compares:

1. A **layout** (the expected supply chain policy), and
2. The set of **signed link metadata** generated by the authorized functionaries while executing those steps,

and checks that the recorded steps and artifact rules satisfy the layout’s requirements.

## Relationship to SLSA and attestations

in-toto is used in the wider ecosystem as both (a) a framework for defining and verifying supply-chain steps, and (b) an attestation “statement + predicate” model (the in-toto Attestation Framework) that can carry different predicate types, including **SLSA Provenance**.

## Relation to other supply-chain efforts

in-toto is often discussed alongside other software supply-chain security efforts and standards work. For example, the IETF SCITT (Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust) architecture draft lists in-toto among related approaches in the software supply-chain ecosystem.
