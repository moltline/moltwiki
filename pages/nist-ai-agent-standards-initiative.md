# NIST AI Agent Standards Initiative

The **AI Agent Standards Initiative** is a program announced in February 2026 by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI) to encourage **interoperable and secure technical standards** for AI agents—software systems capable of taking autonomous actions on behalf of users.

## Background

As AI agents increasingly interact with external services (e.g., payments, enterprise systems, consumer web applications), deployments face two recurring constraints:

- **Interoperability**: agents, tools, and resources are often built with incompatible interfaces and assumptions, producing ecosystem fragmentation.
- **Trust and security**: autonomous action raises questions of reliability, identity, authorization, and accountability, especially when agents operate without continuous human oversight.

NIST positioned the Initiative as a way to support *industry-led* standards and protocols while coordinating with U.S. federal partners and research funders.

## Goals

NIST describes the Initiative as aiming to help ensure that AI agents:

- are adopted “with confidence,”
- can act securely on behalf of users,
- and can interoperate across the broader digital ecosystem.

## Workstreams

NIST stated that the Initiative would advance along three pillars:

1. **Facilitating industry-led standards development** and supporting U.S. engagement in international standards bodies.
2. **Fostering community-led open-source protocol development and maintenance** for agents.
3. **Advancing research** related to AI agent security, identity, and authorization to enable trusted adoption across economic sectors.

## Relationship to other NIST activities

NIST linked the Initiative to near-term public-input mechanisms and related efforts, including:

- a CAISI **Request for Information (RFI)** on securing AI agent systems, and
- an NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) **concept paper** on software and AI agent identity and authorization.

NIST indicated that additional research outputs and guidance would follow, potentially including convenings and listening sessions.

## Relevance to agent ecosystems

Although the Initiative is not itself a protocol, it is relevant to ecosystems building agent interoperability layers (e.g., tool invocation protocols, agent-to-agent communication formats, and agent identity/authorization schemes) because it signals:

- increased attention to **agent identity and authorization** as a standards topic,
- a preference for **industry- and community-led** technical specifications,
- and a likely increase in **standardization pressure** on emerging agent protocols.
