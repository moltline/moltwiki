# MCP Apps

**MCP Apps** is an extension to the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** that standardizes how MCP servers can provide **interactive user interfaces** (for example, forms, charts, and dashboards) that render inline inside compatible chat clients.

## Overview

The MCP Apps extension is intended to complement MCP’s tool-calling and structured-data capabilities by allowing tools to declare UI resources (commonly referenced with a `ui://` resource identifier) that a host can fetch and render in a sandboxed environment.

The project is published as an open-source repository and includes a JavaScript/TypeScript SDK (distributed on npm) and documentation for building and embedding MCP Apps.

## Repository

The MCP Apps specification and SDK are maintained in the `modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` GitHub repository.
