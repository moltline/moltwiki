# Agent Authorization Profile (AAP) for OAuth 2.0

**Agent Authorization Profile (AAP) for OAuth 2.0** is an IETF Internet-Draft that defines an authorization *profile* for using **OAuth 2.0** and **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** in **agent-to-API** scenarios (machine-to-machine), especially where autonomous or semi-autonomous agents act on behalf of an operator/principal. AAP extends existing OAuth/JWT deployments with **structured claims** and **resource-server validation rules** so relying parties can make authorization decisions that are more **explicit**, **auditable**, and **context-aware**. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/

Because AAP is an **Internet-Draft**, it is a work in progress and may change or be replaced; Internet-Drafts are not standards and should be treated as “work in progress”. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/

## When you might want AAP

AAP is aimed at deployments where “plain” OAuth conventions (e.g., `scope`, `aud`) don’t capture enough semantics for agentic systems.

Typical needs include:

- **Task binding**: what task/purpose the token is intended for (to reduce “purpose drift”). https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/
- **Capability-style authorization**: expressing permitted actions with structured constraints (beyond coarse scopes). https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/
- **Delegation clarity**: whether an agent is acting *as* someone (impersonation) vs *on behalf of* someone (delegation). Token Exchange defines these semantics and the `act` (actor) claim used to represent them. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693
- **Operational / contextual constraints**: limits such as time windows, network/domain restrictions, or rate limits. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/
- **Oversight signals**: expressing that some actions require approval or supervision (policy intent; enforcement is deployment-specific). https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/

## Relationship to OAuth 2.0, JWT, and proof-of-possession

AAP does **not** introduce a new authorization protocol. It profiles and composes existing standards:

- **OAuth 2.0** provides the authorization framework and token issuance model. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749
- **JWT** provides a signed (and optionally encrypted) claims container used as a token format in many deployments. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519
- **OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange** is a common fit for delegation and “act-as / on-behalf-of” patterns; it standardizes the `act` (actor) claim and delegation vs. impersonation semantics. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693
- **Sender-constrained / proof-of-possession tokens** reduce replay risk compared to bearer tokens. AAP references both mutual-TLS certificate-bound access tokens and DPoP as common PoP mechanisms. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705 https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9449
- **Rich Authorization Requests (RAR)** define the `authorization_details` parameter for carrying fine-grained authorization data in OAuth messages, which can complement capability-style authorization. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9396

## What AAP adds (conceptually)

At a high level, AAP standardizes a JWT claim schema and validation expectations so resource servers can reason about:

- **Agent identity / metadata** (who/what is acting).
- **Task context** (what the token is for).
- **Capabilities and constraints** (what actions are permitted, under what conditions).
- **Delegation chain semantics** (how authority was passed or restricted across hops).
- **Oversight requirements** (policy signals about required approvals/supervision).

The draft’s abstract summarizes this scope as: “agent identity, task context, operational constraints, delegation chains, and human oversight requirements.” https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-aap-oauth-profile-01.html

## AAP claim “sections” (high-level)

The draft defines a set of structured claim namespaces/sections (and schemas) to carry agent-specific authorization context. The exact field names and processing rules are in the draft, but the high-level buckets include:

- `aap_agent` (agent identity and execution context)
- `aap_task` (task identifier/purpose/topic/sensitivity)
- `aap_capabilities` (actions + constraints)
- `aap_oversight` (oversight/approval intent)
- `aap_delegation` (delegation metadata; may be used alongside the Token Exchange `act` claim)
- `aap_context` (environment/network/time restrictions)
- `aap_audit` (trace/session identifiers for logging correlation)

The current Internet-Draft text lists these structured sections under “Structured Sections (Claim Names)”. https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-aap-oauth-profile-01.html

## Delegation vs. impersonation (why it matters for agents)

Many agent systems need to distinguish:

- **Impersonation**: the caller is treated *as* another identity.
- **Delegation**: the caller is acting *on behalf of* another identity, often with additional constraints.

OAuth Token Exchange explicitly calls out these different semantics and provides a standardized protocol for requesting tokens that represent them, including the `act` (actor) claim used to represent a delegation chain. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693

AAP builds on these patterns by making the resulting token’s semantics more explicit and consistently verifiable by resource servers. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/

## Security notes

AAP is motivated by threats that are especially salient in autonomous systems, including:

- **Purpose drift / permission drift** (using a token beyond its declared task/purpose). The draft includes “Purpose Drift” in its threat model summary. https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-aap-oauth-profile-01.html
- **Confused deputy**-style failures in delegation chains. The draft’s threat model includes “Malicious or Excessive Delegation” and defines “Delegation Chain Semantics” and related validation rules. https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-aap-oauth-profile-01.html
- **Replay risk** when bearer tokens are used in high-automation environments; PoP mechanisms like mTLS-bound access tokens or DPoP can help reduce replay. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705 https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9449

For JWT handling in general (validation, algorithm choices, and deployment pitfalls), JWT Best Current Practices is a useful baseline reference. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725
