# Agent Authorization Profile (AAP) for OAuth 2.0

**Agent Authorization Profile (AAP) for OAuth 2.0** is an IETF Internet-Draft that defines an authorization *profile* for using **OAuth 2.0** and **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** in **agent-to-API** (machine-to-machine) scenarios, especially where autonomous or semi-autonomous agents act on behalf of an operator/principal.

AAP does not introduce a new authorization protocol; it profiles existing OAuth/JWT deployments with **structured claims** and **resource-server validation expectations** so relying parties can make authorization decisions that are more **explicit**, **auditable**, and **context-aware**. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/

Because AAP is an **Internet-Draft**, it is a work in progress and may change or be replaced; Internet-Drafts are not standards. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/

## When you might want AAP

AAP is aimed at deployments where “plain” OAuth conventions (e.g., coarse `scope` strings) don’t capture enough semantics for agentic systems.

Typical needs include:

- **Task / purpose binding**: what the token is intended for (to reduce “purpose drift”). https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/
- **Capability-style authorization**: expressing permitted actions with structured constraints (beyond coarse scopes). https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/
- **Delegation clarity**: whether an agent is acting *as* someone (impersonation) vs *on behalf of* someone (delegation). OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange defines these semantics and the `act` (actor) claim used to represent them. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693
- **Operational / contextual constraints**: limits such as time windows, domain restrictions, or rate limits. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/
- **Oversight signals**: expressing that some actions require approval or supervision (policy intent; enforcement is deployment-specific). https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/

## Relationship to OAuth 2.0, JWT, and proof-of-possession

AAP profiles and composes existing standards:

- **OAuth 2.0** provides the authorization framework and token issuance model. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749
- **JWT** provides a signed (and optionally encrypted) claims container used as a token format in many deployments. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519
- **OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange** is a common fit for delegation and “act-as / on-behalf-of” patterns; it standardizes the `act` (actor) claim and delegation vs. impersonation semantics. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693
- **Sender-constrained / proof-of-possession tokens** reduce replay risk compared to bearer tokens. AAP references both mutual-TLS certificate-bound access tokens and DPoP as common PoP mechanisms. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705 https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9449
- **Rich Authorization Requests (RAR)** define the `authorization_details` parameter for carrying fine-grained authorization data in OAuth messages, which can complement capability-style authorization. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9396

The draft also notes that AAP is typically used in OAuth **client credentials** (agent-to-API / M2M) deployments. https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-aap-oauth-profile-01.txt

## What AAP adds (conceptually)

At a high level, AAP standardizes a JWT claim schema and validation expectations so resource servers can reason about:

- **Agent identity / metadata** (who/what is acting).
- **Task context** (what the token is for).
- **Capabilities and constraints** (what actions are permitted, under what conditions).
- **Delegation chain semantics** (how authority was passed or restricted across hops).
- **Oversight requirements** (policy signals about required approvals/supervision).
- **Audit hooks** (fields intended to support logging / traceability).

## AAP structured claims (normative names)

The draft defines a set of structured JWT claims (“sections”) with **normative claim names**:

- `agent`
- `task`
- `capabilities`
- `oversight`
- `delegation`
- `context`
- `audit`

See Section 5 “JWT Claim Schema (AAP Profile)” and Section 5.2 “Structured Sections (Claim Names)” in the draft text. https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-aap-oauth-profile-01.txt

## How this fits with Token Exchange (`act`) and RAR (`authorization_details`)

- **Token Exchange** (`act` claim): when tokens represent a delegation chain (an agent acting on behalf of someone/something else), Token Exchange provides a standardized way to request such tokens and represent the actor chain in JWTs. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693

- **RAR** (`authorization_details`): RAR defines a structured JSON parameter for fine-grained authorization requests in OAuth messages. AAP’s structured, capability-style intent can be complementary to RAR-based requests, depending on your authorization server and resource server architecture. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9396

## Security notes (JWT handling still matters)

AAP is motivated by threats that are especially salient in autonomous systems, including:

- **Purpose drift / permission drift** (using a token beyond its declared task/purpose). https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/
- **Confused deputy** failures in multi-hop delegation chains. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aap-oauth-profile/
- **Replay risk** when bearer tokens are used in high-automation environments; PoP mechanisms like mTLS-bound access tokens or DPoP can help reduce replay. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705 https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9449

Separately, JWTs have well-known validation pitfalls (algorithm confusion, missing issuer/audience checks, etc.). JWT Best Current Practices is a useful baseline reference for implementers. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725
