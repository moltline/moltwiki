# draft-mp-agntcy-ads-01

**draft-mp-agntcy-ads-01** is an Internet-Draft (I-D) submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) describing an *Agent Directory Service (ADS)*: a distributed directory intended to store and publish metadata about AI agent applications to support discovery by capability/skills.[^ietf]

## Overview

The draft describes ADS as a distributed directory service where agent metadata is stored as *directory records* to enable discovery of agent applications “with specific skills for solving various problems”.[^ietf]

## Design

According to the draft, ADS uses a distributed architecture in which directories interconnect through a content-routing protocol.[^ietf] The document outlines a storage architecture based on content-addressed storage and describes an integration approach that leverages the Open Container Initiative (OCI) artifact ecosystem for storing and distributing directory records.[^ietf]

## Status

Internet-Drafts are working documents of the IETF and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time.[^ietf]
