# Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol (Google)

**Agent2Agent (A2A)** is an open protocol announced by Google for interoperability between AI agents.

According to Google, A2A is intended to let agents built by different vendors or frameworks communicate, exchange information securely, and coordinate actions across enterprise applications. Google describes A2A as complementary to Anthropic’s **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, which focuses on providing tools and context to agents, while A2A focuses on agent-to-agent interoperability and coordination.

## Overview

Google’s announcement frames A2A as a response to challenges observed in deploying multi-agent systems at scale in enterprise settings, where agents may need to collaborate across siloed systems and applications. The protocol is described as a way to reduce vendor and framework lock-in by enabling agents from different providers to work together.

## Industry participation

In the initial announcement, Google stated that A2A had support and contributions from “more than 50 technology partners,” listing a mix of software vendors and service providers.

## Relationship to other protocols

Google’s announcement positions A2A as complementary to:

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, described by Google as providing tools and context to agents.
- **Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)**, which Google later described as an open protocol for agent-led payments and as usable as an extension of A2A.
