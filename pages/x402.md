# x402

**x402** is an open standard for internet-native, machine-readable payments over HTTP. It is named after the HTTP **402 Payment Required** status code and defines a request/response pattern in which an origin server can advertise payment requirements and a client can retry the request with a signed payment payload in HTTP headers.[1][2]

## Overview

In a typical x402 exchange, a client makes a normal HTTP request to a paid endpoint. The resource server responds with **402 Payment Required** and includes payment requirements in a `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header. The client selects an acceptable requirement, creates a payment payload, and resubmits the same request with a `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header. After the server verifies the payload (either locally or via a facilitator service) and settles the payment, it returns the requested resource and may include settlement details in a `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header.[1][2]

The x402 design is intended to be HTTP-native and usable without additional out-of-band protocol steps beyond the standard request/response flow.[2]

## Protocol concepts

### Roles

The reference implementation describes several roles:[1][2]

* **Client**: the entity that pays for a resource.
* **Resource server**: the HTTP server that provides the paid resource.
* **Facilitator**: an optional service that verifies and executes payments for one or more networks on behalf of resource servers.

The Coinbase documentation describes a flow in which the resource server can validate the payment payload locally or by calling a facilitator, and can likewise settle either directly or via a facilitator endpoint.[2]

### Payment requirements and payloads

In the Coinbase reference flow, the resource server returns a **`PAYMENT-REQUIRED`** header containing a Base64-encoded JSON object that includes one or more acceptable payment requirements. A client chooses one requirement and constructs a **payment payload** for the selected *(scheme, network)* pair, then retries the original request with a **`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`** header containing the payload.[1][2]

If the payment is executed successfully, the resource server returns the protected resource (typically with HTTP 200) and includes a **`PAYMENT-RESPONSE`** header containing Base64-encoded settlement details.[1][2]

### Schemes and networks

x402 distinguishes between **schemes** (logical payment flows) and **networks** (the underlying settlement system). Clients and facilitators must explicitly support different *(scheme, network)* pairs in order to construct, verify, and settle payments.[1]

A **scheme** specifies how value is transferred for a request. The Coinbase repository describes **`exact`** as the first shipping scheme, which transfers a specific amount (for example, paying a fixed price to access a resource), and uses **`upto`** as an example of a hypothetical scheme that would transfer up to an amount based on resources consumed (for example, LLM tokens).[1]

## Implementations and ecosystem

Coinbase maintains an open-source repository containing the protocol specification, reference SDKs (TypeScript, Python, Go), and examples.[1]

Cloudflare announced a partnership with Coinbase to create the **x402 Foundation** to encourage adoption of the x402 protocol. Cloudflare also described shipping x402-related features in its Agents SDK and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations, and proposed a **deferred** payment scheme intended to decouple a cryptographic commitment from later settlement (for example, to support aggregation or delayed settlement in some deployments).[3]

Stripe has published documentation describing **x402 payments** as a private-preview feature for machine-to-machine payments in which a server returns HTTP 402 with payment details and the client retries with an authorization. In Stripe’s described flow, Stripe provides deposit addresses and captures a PaymentIntent when funds settle on-chain.[4]

## Relationship to HTTP 402

HTTP defines **402 (Payment Required)** as a reserved status code for future use.[5] x402 uses 402 as the signaling mechanism for payment requirements and defines associated header fields and payload formats to make the interaction machine-readable.[1][2]
