# x402

**x402** is an open standard for internet-native payments built on HTTP. It uses the HTTP **402 Payment Required** status code and associated headers to let a resource server require payment for an HTTP request, enabling programmatic payments between clients (including AI agents) and servers with minimal additional protocol surface.

## Overview

In a typical x402 flow, a client requests a protected resource and a resource server can respond with **402 Payment Required** plus payment requirements. The client selects an acceptable option, constructs a signed payment payload, and retries the request with payment information in HTTP headers. The resource server verifies the payment (locally or via a **facilitator** service) and, if valid, fulfills the request and returns the resource.

Coinbase’s documentation describes the flow as using a `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` response header to convey requirements and a `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` request header to submit a signed payment payload, with a `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header used to return settlement details after successful execution.[2][1]

## Protocol concepts

The reference implementation describes several roles:[1][2]

* **Client**: the entity paying for a resource.
* **Resource server**: the HTTP server providing the paid resource.
* **Facilitator**: an optional service that can verify and execute payments for one or more networks.

x402 distinguishes between **schemes** (logical payment flows) and **networks** (the underlying settlement system). Clients and facilitators support specific *(scheme, network)* pairs.[1]

### Schemes

A **scheme** defines how value is transferred for a request. The Coinbase reference repository describes **`exact`** as the initial scheme, intended to transfer a specific amount (for example, paying a fixed price to access a resource). It also notes that other schemes are possible (for example, usage-based designs), but would require their own specifications and implementations.[1]

## Implementations and ecosystem

Coinbase maintains a public repository that includes specifications, reference SDKs, and examples for x402 across multiple programming languages.[1]

Stripe has also published documentation describing **x402 payments** as a way to implement machine-to-machine payments, with x402 currently described there as a private preview feature.[3]
