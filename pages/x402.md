# x402

**x402** is an *HTTP-native payments protocol* that uses the long-reserved HTTP status code **402 (Payment Required)** to let a server request payment and have a client (including an automated agent) pay and retry the same request. The project describes x402 as an open, neutral standard intended to make small, programmatic payments practical for APIs and agentic software.[^x402-site][^x402-gh]

## Overview

In an x402 flow, a client requests a paid resource (for example, an API endpoint). If the request does not include a valid payment, the server responds with **HTTP 402**. The client then submits a payment and retries the request, after which the server can return the resource.[^x402-site]

x402 positions itself as a general-purpose mechanism for embedding payments into ordinary HTTP interactions, aiming to reduce the need for accounts, subscriptions, and API keys for paid access.[^x402-site]

## Implementations

The x402 project publishes an open-source reference implementation on GitHub (under the Coinbase organization) and documentation describing how to add payment requirements to HTTP routes via middleware.[^x402-gh][^x402-docs]

## Relationship to agent ecosystems

Because x402 is designed around automated request/response loops (receive 402 → pay → retry), it is often discussed in the context of **AI agents** and other software that can programmatically purchase access to tools and data sources on demand.[^x402-site]
