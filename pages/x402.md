# x402

**x402** is an open standard for internet-native, machine-readable payments over HTTP. It is named after the HTTP **402 Payment Required** status code and defines a request/response pattern in which an origin server can advertise payment requirements and a client can retry the request with a signed payment payload in HTTP headers.[1][2]

## Overview

In a typical x402 exchange, a client makes a normal HTTP request to a paid endpoint. The resource server responds with **402 Payment Required** and includes payment requirements in a `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header. The client selects an acceptable requirement, creates a payment payload, and resubmits the same request with a `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header. After the server verifies the payload (either locally or via a facilitator service) and settles the payment, it returns the requested resource and may include settlement details in a `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header.[1][2]

The x402 design is intended to be HTTP-native and usable without additional out-of-band protocol steps beyond the standard request/response flow.[2]

## Protocol concepts

The reference implementation describes several roles:[1]

* **Client**: the entity that pays for a resource.
* **Resource server**: the HTTP server that provides the paid resource.
* **Facilitator**: an optional service that verifies and executes payments for one or more networks on behalf of resource servers.[1][2]

In Coinbase’s documentation, a typical flow begins with a 402 response that carries payment requirements in the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header, followed by a retried request containing a `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header. If the payment is accepted and settled, the server returns the resource and may include settlement details in a `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header.[2]

x402 distinguishes between **schemes** (logical payment flows) and **networks** (the underlying settlement system). Implementations typically support specific *(scheme, network)* combinations.[1]

### Schemes

A **scheme** specifies how value is transferred for a request. The Coinbase repository describes **`exact`** as the first shipping scheme, which transfers a specific amount (for example, paying a fixed price to access a resource), and gives an example of a hypothetical **`upto`** scheme that would transfer up to an amount based on resources consumed (for example, LLM tokens).[1]

## Implementations and ecosystem

Coinbase maintains an open-source repository containing the protocol specification (in `specs/`) and reference SDKs. As of late 2025, Coinbase’s TypeScript reference packages are published under the **`@x402`** npm organization and include modules for core types, HTTP clients, and server middleware for common frameworks (for example Express, Hono, Next.js, and Fetch).[1]

Coinbase’s developer documentation describes x402 as an HTTP-based protocol for automatic stablecoin payments, and highlights features such as CAIP-2 network identifiers, multi-network support (including EVM and Solana networks), and an extensions system.[5]

The x402 project has described a **V2** update that modernizes the protocol, including removing deprecated `X-*` headers in favor of `PAYMENT-REQUIRED`, `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`, and `PAYMENT-RESPONSE`, and introducing a more modular SDK and extensions-oriented design.[7]

In December 2025, the V2 announcement also described “wallet-based access” concepts intended to reduce per-request payment overhead for repeated access patterns, and a discovery-oriented extension for publishing structured service metadata.[7]

Cloudflare announced a partnership with Coinbase to create the **x402 Foundation** to encourage adoption of the x402 protocol, and described shipping x402-related features in Cloudflare’s Agents SDK and MCP integrations, as well as proposing a deferred-payment scheme for future versions of the protocol.[6]

Stripe has published documentation describing **x402 payments** as a private-preview feature for machine-to-machine payments in which a server returns HTTP 402 with payment details. In Stripe’s flow, Stripe handles deposit addresses and captures a PaymentIntent when funds settle on-chain.[3]

## Relationship to HTTP 402

HTTP defines **402 (Payment Required)** as a reserved status code for future use.[4] x402 uses 402 as the signaling mechanism for payment requirements and defines associated header fields and payload formats to make the interaction machine-readable.[1][2]
