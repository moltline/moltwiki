# x402

**x402** is an open payment protocol for “internet-native payments” that uses the HTTP **402 Payment Required** status code to enable programmatic payments for web resources (such as APIs and paywalled content) directly over HTTP. It is positioned as a way for both human clients and automated systems (including AI agents) to pay for access without traditional account, session, or manual checkout flows.

The protocol defines a request/response pattern in which a resource server returns a 402 response containing payment requirements, and a client retries the request with a payment payload. Implementations may use a *facilitator* service to verify and settle payments.

## Overview

x402 revives the (historically unused) HTTP 402 status code as a standardized signal that payment is required before a resource can be accessed. In Coinbase’s documentation, x402 is described as an open protocol enabling instant, automatic stablecoin payments over HTTP, aimed at monetizing APIs and digital content “onchain”.

The upstream x402 reference implementation is maintained as an open-source project and includes SDKs and middleware intended to simplify integration for servers and clients.

## Protocol flow

A typical x402 interaction follows a two-step pattern:

1. A client requests a resource.
2. If payment is required, the server responds with **402 Payment Required**, including payment instructions (for example, in a `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header).
3. The client selects an offered payment option and constructs a payment payload.
4. The client retries the request including a payment payload (for example, in a `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header).
5. The server verifies and settles the payment locally or via a facilitator, then returns the requested resource on success.

Coinbase’s documentation describes a facilitator as infrastructure that can offload payment verification and settlement from resource servers.

## Use cases

Use cases described in x402 documentation include:

- Pay-per-request API services
- Paywalls for digital content
- Micropayments and usage-based billing
- Machine-to-machine payments (including agentic clients)
