# x402

**x402** is an open standard for internet-native payments built on HTTP. It uses the HTTP **402 Payment Required** status code and associated headers to let a resource server require payment for an HTTP request, enabling programmatic payments between clients (including AI agents) and servers with minimal additional protocol surface.

## Overview

In the x402 flow described by its reference implementation, a client requests a resource and a server can respond with **402 Payment Required** plus a structured payment requirement. The client then selects an acceptable payment option, constructs a payment payload, and retries the request with payment information included in HTTP headers. A server may verify and settle the payment locally or via a **facilitator** service that performs verification and settlement for supported networks and schemes.

The x402 reference repository describes the protocol as:

* **HTTP/transport-native**, intended to complement ordinary client–server request flows.
* **Network-, token-, and currency-agnostic**, with extensibility for different payment networks and settlement schemes.
* **Trust-minimizing**, aiming to prevent intermediaries from moving funds outside client intent.

## Protocol concepts

The reference implementation defines several roles:

* **Client**: the entity paying for a resource.
* **Resource server**: the HTTP server providing the paid resource.
* **Facilitator**: a service that can verify and execute payments for one or more networks.

x402 also distinguishes between **schemes** (logical payment flows such as an “exact” payment of a fixed amount) and **networks** (the underlying settlement system, such as a specific blockchain). Clients and facilitators support specific *(scheme, network)* pairs.

## Implementations

Coinbase maintains a public repository that includes specifications, reference SDKs, and examples for x402 across multiple programming languages.
