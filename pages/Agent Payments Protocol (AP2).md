# Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)

**Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)** is an open protocol announced by Google for enabling AI agents to securely initiate and transact payments on behalf of users across platforms. In Google’s description, AP2 is designed to provide a payment-method-agnostic framework for agent-led commerce, and it can be used as an extension of the **Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol** and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. [1]

## Overview

As described by Google, AP2 aims to address challenges that arise when autonomous or semi-autonomous agents initiate transactions, including: [1]

- **Authorization**: proving that a user gave an agent specific authority to make a particular purchase.
- **Authenticity**: enabling a merchant to validate that an agent’s request reflects the user’s intent.
- **Accountability**: supporting auditability and dispute handling if a fraudulent or incorrect transaction occurs.

Google positions AP2 as an open, shared protocol that provides a common language between agents, merchants, and payments providers to help prevent a fragmented ecosystem. [1]

## Design concepts

### Mandates

Google describes AP2 as building trust using **mandates**—tamper-proof, cryptographically signed digital contracts that serve as verifiable proof of a user’s instructions. [1]

In Google’s description, mandates can be chained to preserve context through a transaction flow (for example, from an **Intent Mandate** to a **Cart Mandate**), with the goal of creating an auditable sequence from intent to cart to payment. [1]

Google distinguishes two common shopping modes: [1]

- **Real-time purchases (human present)**: a user request is captured in an Intent Mandate, and the user approval of the final cart signs a Cart Mandate.
- **Delegated tasks (human not present)**: a user signs a detailed Intent Mandate up front (e.g., constraints like price limits and timing), allowing the agent to generate a Cart Mandate when conditions are met.

### Verifiable credentials

Google’s announcement describes mandates as being signed using **verifiable credentials (VCs)**, tying AP2’s trust model to the broader verifiable credentials ecosystem. [1]

A later Google Cloud post about an AP2-enabled merchant offering (with payments powered by PayPal) describes mandates as being signed by **Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs)** and gives examples of credential types used in the flow, including: [2]

- **Cart Mandate**: generated by the merchant and cryptographically signed by the user (typically via their device) to bind authorization to a specific transaction.
- **Payment Mandate**: a separate credential shared with payment networks and issuers to provide signals that the transaction was agentic and to indicate modality (e.g., human present vs. not present).

## Reference implementation and samples

Google maintains a public GitHub repository with code samples and demonstrations for AP2. The repository notes that samples use Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini 2.5 Flash, but that AP2 itself does not require those specific tools. [3]

## Relationship to other protocols

Google describes AP2 as complementary to existing agent interoperability work, including: [1]

- **Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol**
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

Google also describes AP2 as supporting multiple payment types (including stablecoins and cryptocurrencies) and points to the **A2A x402 extension** as an example of extending AP2 constructs for agent-based crypto payments. [1]
