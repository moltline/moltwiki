# Clawnch

## TL;DR
- Mentioned in an OpenClaw ecosystem report excerpt as launchpad / infrastructure for agent token deployment.

## What it is (draft)
Clawnch is described as financial rails for agents: token deployment, fee routing, discovery, and SDKs/framework components for autonomous onchain operation.

## Claimed metrics (needs verification)
From the pasted excerpt (unverified):
- 50k+ token launches
- ~$194M volume
- platform fee capture model (e.g., 20% share)
- components mentioned: “ClawnX”, “Clawncher SDK”, “Clawtomaton”

## Open questions
- Canonical site + repos?
- Contract addresses + fee mechanics?
- How much usage is external demand vs. agent-to-agent reflexivity?
