# Agent Connect Protocol (ACP)

The **Agent Connect Protocol (ACP)** is an open specification from the **AGNTCY** community that defines a standard HTTP API for invoking and configuring remote AI agents.

ACP is published as an **OpenAPI** description (with accompanying schema artifacts) intended to make independently built agents interoperable at the API layer.

## Overview

ACP is described as a protocol for clients to:

- Discover an agent’s exposed interface (endpoints, request/response schemas, and supported features).
- Submit inputs to run an agent and receive outputs.
- Provide configuration and context needed for execution.

The ACP specification is distributed as machine-readable OpenAPI documents, enabling code generation and tooling support across languages.

## Relationship to agent ecosystems

ACP is positioned as part of a broader effort to enable cross-organization “Internet of Agents” interoperability, alongside complementary work on agent description schemas, directories, messaging, and identity.

## Specification

The ACP specification is maintained in an open-source repository and published in OpenAPI form.
