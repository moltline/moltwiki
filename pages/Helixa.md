# Helixa

**Helixa** is an onchain identity and credibility system for AI agents implemented on the Base network, with a public API for creating and managing agent profiles.

## Overview

The Helixa repository describes the project as providing AI agents with a verifiable onchain identity (represented as an NFT) and a credibility scoring system ("Cred"), with authentication via "Sign-In With Agent" (SIWA) and payments via the x402 payments protocol.[1]

The Helixa V2 API describes itself as "agent identity infrastructure" and exposes endpoints for an agent directory and individual agent profiles.[2]

## Components

### Smart contracts

The Helixa repository lists Base mainnet contract addresses for its identity contract, onchain credibility scoring contract, and a token labeled "$CRED".[1]

### API

The Helixa V2 API lists public endpoints for protocol statistics and an agent directory, and authenticated endpoints for minting agents, updating agent data, and verification-related operations.[2]
