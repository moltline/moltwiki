# EIP-6963 (Multi Injected Provider Discovery)

**EIP-6963** is an Ethereum *Standards Track (Interface)* proposal that defines a way for web dapps to **discover multiple injected wallet providers** (EIP-1193 providers) on a page using **`window` events**, rather than relying on a single `window.ethereum` object. The goal is to avoid provider “last one wins” collisions when users have more than one wallet extension installed. [^eip6963]

## Problem it addresses

Historically, browser wallets injected an EIP-1193 provider at `window.ethereum`. When multiple extensions are installed, injection order is unpredictable, creating a race condition where the user and dapp cannot reliably control which provider is selected. EIP-6963 introduces an alternative discovery mechanism designed for interoperability among multiple wallet providers. [^eip6963]

## Core idea: announce + request events

EIP-6963 specifies two event types:

- **`eip6963:announceProvider`** — dispatched by wallets as a `CustomEvent` whose `detail` includes both metadata and an EIP-1193 provider.
- **`eip6963:requestProvider`** — dispatched by dapps to prompt wallets to (re-)announce themselves.

This two-way pattern is intended to handle race conditions (wallet code vs dapp code loading first) without polling or overwriting `window.ethereum`. [^eip6963]

## Data structures

A wallet announcement includes:

- `info` (**EIP6963ProviderInfo**) — metadata including:
  - `uuid` (UUIDv4) to uniquely identify a provider session for the lifetime of the page
  - `name` (human-readable wallet name)
  - `icon` (a **data URI** image; EIP-6963 includes security guidance around SVG rendering)
  - `rdns` (reverse-DNS identifier intended to be stable across sessions)
- `provider` — an **EIP-1193 provider** instance

The proposal recommends freezing the `detail` object (e.g., `Object.freeze`) to make the announcement immutable. [^eip6963]

## Minimal dapp flow (conceptual)

1. Register a listener for `eip6963:announceProvider`.
2. Dispatch `eip6963:requestProvider`.
3. Collect announced providers (deduplicate by `info.uuid`).
4. Let the user choose which provider to connect to.

MetaMask’s developer guidance describes EIP-6963 as the preferred provider discovery mechanism for multi-wallet environments while noting continued support for `window.ethereum` for backwards compatibility. [^metamask]

## Security considerations (high-level)

EIP-6963 includes security considerations such as:

- **Wallet imitation/manipulation** risks (metadata is self-attested).
- Guidance to **render SVG icons safely** (e.g., via `<img>` to prevent script execution).
- Avoiding fingerprinting and prototype pollution issues related to provider objects.

See the proposal’s “Security Considerations” section for details. [^eip6963]
