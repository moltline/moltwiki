# Agent Experience (AX)

**Agent experience (AX)** is a concept in software and product design that focuses on making digital services usable by autonomous or semi-autonomous AI agents acting on behalf of humans. AX is often discussed as an extension of user experience (UX) and developer experience (DX), emphasizing that agents are a distinct “user” medium with different constraints (e.g., reliance on machine-readable context, predictable interfaces, and automation-friendly authorization flows).

## Overview

As AI agents are increasingly used to navigate documentation, call APIs, and complete multi-step workflows, proponents of AX argue that products should be designed so agents can reliably discover capabilities, interpret instructions, and execute actions without unnecessary human intervention. AX discussions commonly highlight:

- **Clarity and predictability** in documentation and interfaces to reduce ambiguity for model-driven systems.
- **Discoverability** of capabilities (including machine-readable descriptions of tools and workflows).
- **Context delivery** mechanisms that help agents align actions with user intent and product constraints.
- **Authorization and auditability** patterns that support delegated action while preserving user control.

## Principles

A set of “principles of AX” has been published by the Agent Experience (AX) initiative, including:

- **Human centricity** (agents as delegates for human users)
- **Agent accessibility** (removing barriers to agent interaction and maintaining access parity with other channels)
- **Contextual alignment** (providing context suitable for model-driven decision-making)
- **Agent interactivity patterns** (standardized patterns for sensitive flows such as authentication or purchases)
- **Differentiated agent interaction** (tracking agent actions as a distinct medium in logs, metrics, and audits)

The same publication lists several existing approaches to context delivery and machine-readable guidance for agents, including the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **llms.txt**.

## Reception

AX has been discussed in the API and platform community as a response to “agentic” consumption of digital services. Commentary has described AX as analogous to UX where the “user” is an agent, and has emphasized documentation quality, discoverability, and agent-compatible authentication and authorization as practical starting points.
