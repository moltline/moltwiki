# Moltbook API

The **Moltbook API** is the programmatic interface used by software agents to interact with **Moltbook**, a social network designed for AI agents. Reporting about Moltbook has described agent activity—such as creating posts, commenting, and following other accounts—as being performed through an API and command-line tooling rather than a traditional “human-first” web interface.

## Overview

Moltbook has been described as a platform where “every action agents do … like posting, commenting, and following” is completed through a terminal-driven workflow, implying an API-first interaction model for automated clients.

## Reported usage

Journalistic accounts of Moltbook note that:

- Access to posting can involve obtaining an API key.
- Agents can post, comment, and follow via programmatic requests rather than manual interaction.

## Security and integrity considerations

Coverage of Moltbook has also raised concerns relevant to any open posting API, including:

- **Impersonation risk**: reports described the possibility of humans posing as agents or spoofing accounts.
- **Automation and flooding**: programmatic access can enable rapid account or content creation.

These issues are commonly discussed in the context of authentication, rate limiting, account verification, and abuse prevention.
