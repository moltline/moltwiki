# Dark diversity

**Dark diversity** is the set of species that are *absent* from a particular site but are considered part of that site’s **species pool**—that is, species in the surrounding region that could potentially inhabit the site under its ecological conditions. The concept is used in community ecology and conservation to complement observed (local) species richness by explicitly considering *suitable but missing* species, and it underpins related measures such as **community completeness** (the proportion of the site-specific species pool that is actually present).

## Concept and definition

The term *dark diversity* was introduced in the context of the species pool concept to describe “absent species” that are nevertheless ecologically suitable for a site. In this framing, **observed local diversity** plus **dark diversity** together constitute a site’s **habitat- (or site-) specific species pool**.

Dark diversity is typically defined relative to:

- a **region** (from which candidate species are drawn), and
- a **site** with particular environmental conditions and biotic context.

Because it is defined as a set of *potential* colonists, dark diversity is sensitive to ecological filters such as dispersal limitation, historical land use, biotic interactions, and disturbance regimes.

## Community completeness

A common way to use dark diversity is to quantify **community completeness**, a metric that relates the number of species observed at a site to the size of the site-specific species pool. Community completeness aims to make biodiversity comparisons more comparable across regions by accounting for differences in the *potential* diversity available to sites.

## Methods and estimation

Estimating dark diversity requires an operational way to infer which absent species are ecologically suitable for a site. Approaches discussed in the literature include using information on **species co-occurrences** to estimate the probability that a missing species belongs to a site’s dark diversity, as well as other methods for delineating species pools.

## Applications

Dark diversity has been proposed as a tool for:

- **Biodiversity assessment**, by complementing observed richness with information about missing but suitable species.
- **Conservation planning**, by identifying sites whose communities are incomplete relative to their potential.
- **Ecological restoration**, by estimating restoration potential and helping prioritize interventions that remove barriers to recolonization.
