# Payment Request API

The **Payment Request API** is a web platform API that standardizes how a merchant website can invoke a browser-provided payment UI and exchange payment information with the user agent. It is part of the broader W3C Web Payments work and is designed to reduce checkout friction compared with traditional, form-based payment flows.[^mdn]

## Overview

A merchant site typically creates a `PaymentRequest` object in response to a user gesture (e.g., clicking a “Buy” button). The browser then presents a native or browser UI that lets the user select a payment method and provide the necessary details. If the user approves, the site receives a `PaymentResponse` containing the selected payment method identifier and associated data.[^mdn]

The Payment Request API is commonly discussed alongside related specifications in the Web Payments ecosystem, including:

- **Payment Handler API** (enables web-based payment apps to handle payment requests)[^w3c-payment-handler]
- **Payment Method Identifiers** (defines identifiers used to name payment methods in the ecosystem)[^w3c-payment-method-id]
- **Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC)** (a W3C specification that integrates with Payment Request flows and WebAuthn for stronger authentication)[^spc]

## Key concepts

- **User agent–mediated payment UI:** The browser mediates the user experience for selecting and authorizing payment, rather than the merchant building a bespoke checkout UI.[^mdn]
- **Payment method identifiers:** The API uses payment method identifiers to indicate which payment methods a merchant supports and which method the user selected.[^w3c-payment-method-id]
- **Extensibility via payment handlers:** Payment handlers allow payment apps (including web-based ones) to integrate with the Payment Request flow.[^w3c-payment-handler]
