# Microsoft Agent Framework

**Microsoft Agent Framework** is a developer framework for building AI agents and multi-step agentic workflows. Public documentation describes two primary capability categories:

- **Agents**: individual agents that use LLMs to process inputs and call tools (including **MCP servers**) before generating responses.
- **Workflows**: graph-based workflows that connect agents and functions for multi-step tasks, with features such as type-safe routing, checkpointing, and human-in-the-loop support.

The docs also describe supporting building blocks such as model clients, session/state management, context providers (memory), middleware for intercepting agent actions, and MCP clients for tool integration.
