# Google Cloud donates A2A to the Linux Foundation

**Google Cloud donates A2A to the Linux Foundation** refers to Google Cloud’s transfer of the **Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol** specification and related software assets to a Linux Foundation–hosted project for vendor-neutral stewardship.

## Background

The **Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol** is an open standard intended to enable interoperability between distinct AI agents, including discovery of agent capabilities and secure exchange of information for coordination across systems. In April 2025, Google announced A2A as an agent interoperability protocol. In June 2025, the Linux Foundation announced the launch of an **Agent2Agent (A2A) project** to host the protocol under neutral governance.

## Donation and project formation

On **June 23, 2025**, Google Cloud stated that, at Open Source Summit North America, the Linux Foundation announced formation of the Agent2Agent project with multiple founding participants, and that the project would be seeded with Google’s transfer of the A2A specification along with accompanying SDKs and developer tooling. The Linux Foundation described the A2A project as an open protocol effort created by Google for secure agent-to-agent communication and collaboration, intended to support interoperable agent systems across vendors, platforms, and frameworks.

## Reception and ecosystem context

Coverage of the donation and project launch characterized the move as part of a broader push toward open standards for agent interoperability and vendor-neutral governance for multi-agent infrastructure.
